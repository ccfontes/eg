*eg* delivers `clojure.test` function tests with conciseness.

```clj
(deftest inc-test
  (is (= 1 (inc 0))))
```
in *eg* becomes:
```clj
(eg inc [0] 1)
```

Core ideas driving *eg*:
  - **conciseness** â€“ spend less time reading and writing test boilerplate
  - **flexibility**:
    - switch order of examples to improve readability
    - check return against a predicate or equality relative to other data types
    - focus on specific tests while developing
  - **examples as data** - for trivial tool support, examples are just data!
  - **function like test definitions** - akin to `clojure.spec/fdef`, but for tests
  - **compatibility with clojure.test** - along with its excelent tooling support

*eg* targets both Clojure and ClojureScript JVM. Untested for ClojureScript JS.

## Installation
**Disclaimer:** *eg* is work-in-progress. Use it at your own risk!

**Leiningen/Boot**
```clj
[eg "0.2.4-alpha"]
```
**Clojure CLI/deps.edn**
```clj
eg {:mvn/version "0.2.4-alpha"}
```

## Usage
`eg` stands for *e.g.* (short for example), and `ge` is just `eg` reversed. Reversed example: `(ge inc 1 [0])`.

Let's try *eg*! Start by creating a REPL session and then requiring `eg` and `ge`:
```clj
(require '[eg :refer [eg ge]])
```

Each *eg* test tests one function using examples. You could think of it as a function's test definition:
```clj
  (eg not   ; testing clojure.core/not
    [false] ; with input parameters vector `[false]`
    true)   ; returning expected value `true`
```
a `clojure.test` test named `not-test` was generated.

There are times when we prefer to have expected values
on the left, and input parameters on the right.
For that we use `ge`, a useful mnemonic for the inverted flow of the test example:
```clj
  (ge + 10 [3 7]) ; one liners are also ok, as with `defn`
```

Each *eg* test can contain an arbitrary number of examples:
```clj
  (eg *
    [3]   3
    [3 2] 6)
```

Predicates can also be used in place of an expected value:
```clj
(eg dec [4] integer?)
```

`=>` or `<=` delimiters between input parameters and expected value can be used to improve readability, or
override the default order of `eg` or `ge`.
```clj
(eg hash-map
  [:d 1] {:d 1}
  [:a 1 :b 2 :c 3 :d 4] => {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3 :d 4}
  map? <= {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3 :d 4})
```

It's possible to run only selected tests by using metadata `^:focus` on `eg` or `ge`:
```clj
(eg ^:focus false? [false] true)
```
There are some caveats to consider when using `^:focus` **with ClojureScript**:
  1. The tests report counts towards non focused tests, although assertions under such tests are not executed.
  2. Assertions for tests defined directly with `clojure.test/deftest` will be executed, despite the presence of focused `eg`, or `ge` tests. 

Between `eg`, and `ge`, choose the form that is most convenient for your combination of function examples and use it **only once** for testing a function. For example, **don't do this**:
```clj
(ge inc [1] 2)
(ge inc [0] 1)
```
**or this:**
```clj
(eg inc [1] 2)
(ge inc [0] 1)
```

## Run your tests
Finally, run your tests as you normally would with `clojure.test`.

**Clojure tests in the REPL:**
```clj
(clojure.test/run-all-tests)
; or
(clojure.test/run-tests some.ns)
```

**Clojure tests in the terminal:**
```
> lein test
```

**ClojureScript tests in the REPL:**
```clj
(cljs.test/run-all-tests)
; or
(cljs.test/run-tests some.ns)
```

## Roadmap
  1. Support expression testing
  2. Fix broken :^focus in cljs after changing its algo - revert to using external dep
  3. document clipboard dev flow
  4. Create focus of test using don't-cares
  5. Document being able to skip a test with vanilla clojure
  6. Suffix test name with '-slow' when using ':slow' selector
  7. Mention:
     - leiningen `test-selectors` for use of metadata
     - https://github.com/weavejester/eftest
  8. Spec API macros `eg` and `ge`
  9. Test against ClojureScript JS
  10. Create API to access example data for i.e. tool use
  11. Reduce clojure and clojurescript requirements
  12. Provide workaround to remove warning of eg being a single segment ns

## Run eg's own tests
Run tests expected to pass, targeting Clojure:
```clj
> lein clj-test-pass
```
Run tests expected to pass, targeting ClojureScript JVM->nodejs:
```clj
> lein cljs-test-pass
```
Run tests expected to fail, targeting Clojure:
```clj
> lein clj-test-fail
```
Run tests expected to fail, targeting ClojureScript JVM->nodejs:
```clj
> lein cljs-test-fail
```
